# Advanced .htaccess Rules

In my previous .htaccess tutorial, we went over basic .htaccess commands like how to remove extensions and do redirects. This time, we take what we know about .htaccess and add advanced rules. 

In this tutorial, we will go over more redirect types,  how to block bots and bad user agents, how to prevent URL sniffing, and how to optimize your images, code, and website through a .htaccess file.

If you are a PHP developer, these are advanced .htaccess directives you need to know.
